Next-gen **[Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp)** framework.

- **SSR/SSG generation.** Exports pages with server functions or statically.
- **Insanely fast.** Uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/) for bundling and [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp) (1KB) as view layer.
- **JSX support**. Use [`@hyperlight/jsx`]() for automatic JSX support.
- **Types out of the box**. Written in TypeScript, it provides types out of the box.
- **Dev server with persisting state**. State is preserved on file change.

## Quick start

```sh
pnpx create-hyperlight-app
